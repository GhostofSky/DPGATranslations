-Your Majesty, I have also heard about that child... If there is any chance that the child can improve Your Majesty's condition, then we must meet them at least once. I promise Your Majesty, even if the child knows nothing, I will protect their safety at the cost of my own honor. Where is the child?

-I don't know. I truly don't know. It's all meaningless because neither the seer nor the boy knows where he is in the end..

Charlotte once told me that I was the only one who had a clue about Valier.

Did it have something to do with what Charlotte was going through? And was Charlotte not contacting Valier anymore because I might be in danger?

There is a high chance that Charlotte's power is not a supernatural ability at all.

If her power was simply dangerous, there would be no reason for them to suggest finding me.

"I am prepared, Turner. If I ever get blood on my hands again, please kill me."

... In the end.

Charlotte was indeed responsible for the death at the Spring Palace.

Her ability had gone out of control and she killed someone.

And she didn't even remember it.

"...Your Majesty."

-Promise me.

-...I cannot promise that.

-Promise me. Please.

Saviolin Turner said nothing in response to Charlotte begging for death.

The conversation was over.

I quickly hid myself in the instrument storage room next to the training room at the end of the right corridor. The door was open and there were no instruments stored inside. I knew it was an instrument storage room just by the few stands left inside.

All the instruments must have been taken away by the musicians.

I hesitated to close the door because the sound of it might give me away, so I hid myself in the darkness of the room.

There was no doubt that neither Charlotte, Dyrus nor Saviolin Turner had any business here. There was nothing to be done even in the practice room, so there was even less reason to come here.

The storage room was dimly lit without any lights, but what I needed was darkness and silence.

It was actually a good situation.

-Swish.

Charlotte's bedroom door opened and Dyrus and Turner's footsteps could be heard.

-Wouldn't it be better to watch her sleep?

-It's useless. She even tied up her own body and slept. But, it was all meaningless.

-... I see. But she still can't leave the palace?

- For now, although....... Maybe it's just because she doesn’t want to leave.

- Are you saying that she might show up at the Tetra or the Winter Palace?

- It's just speculation. I can only hope that it is not possible...

They were clearly talking about an event that had already occurred, but without knowing what that event was, I couldn't follow the conversation.

She's not limited in her movement.

That was all I could understand about Charlotte's ability.

"By the way, is your shoulder okay?"

"...It's fine, it's not a big wound. I let my guard down. It's still something I can handle."

"Are you going to see a priest?"

"...If there's a record of me being treated by a priest, it could be dangerous. I don't want the emperor to realize that she could hurt me.... You know what that would mean."

"Yes."

"He might hear about it. Let's keep this conversation between us."

"I understand... I was too rash."

Charlotte's ability went out of control and caused injury to Saviolin Turner.

She can even hurt her...

Is Charlotte's power strong enough to hurt the Shanapell commander?

It seems that they have kept the fact that Charlotte injured Saviolin Turner a secret.

Will Charlotte's powers overwhelm her, causing her to lose control, forcing Saviolin Turner to act defensively, eventually realizing it's too late and killing her?

"Hmm..."

As they approached the palace stairs leading to the first floor, Saviolin Turner stopped walking.

"What's wrong?"

I feel it.

She is on guard.

"Something..."

I held my breath.

I erased my presence.

Saviolin Turner feels something. How much time has passed?

"It seems like I haven't been sleeping properly. It's nothing."

"How many days has it been?"

"About a week, I guess. I don't know exactly."

"Shouldn't you rest during the day?"

-This matter as well as my position as Shanapell's commander do not allow me any free time.

-I see...

Daytime is for official duties.

Nighttime is for guarding Charlotte.

It seems like Saviolin Turner hasn't been able to rest for quite some time.

The two of them resumed moving and went down the stairs.

I held my breath and didn't exhale.

Just a little bit more.

Get a little further away.

"You've done well, Dyrus. Go back."

"Yes, milady...but, are you fine? You look tired."

"It's not like you can stay either way, right?"

"I understand..."

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be sarcastic. I guess I'm a bit on edge too."

-No, I didn't think so at all.

-Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that. Get some rest, you've been through a lot.

-Well, I hope nothing happens.

-Yeah.

Dyrus left the Spring Palace.

I thought the reason for thinning out the palace was so that no one would see Charlotte killed by Saviolin Turner, but there was another reason too. Perhaps it was likely to prevent someone from sacrificing themselves to stop Charlotte's rampage.

There were only three people left in the palace: me, Saviolin Turner, and Charlotte.

...It meant that my life was in danger too.

Should I leave the palace? I was already clearly in danger.

I couldn't tell if the danger signal from my senses was a warning about Charlotte or a warning about myself.

I heard the sound of Saviolin Turner collapsing onto a chair in the hall.

Leaving here was the right thing to do. Charlotte was powerful, and Turner could handle her, but I couldn't. It was more likely that I was the one in danger.

-Rrrrrrrr

But I couldn't even leave in the first place.

Saviolin Turner sat in the hall that was in front of the entrance to Charlotte’s room. As if to keep an eye on things.

-Pop! -Pop!

Saviolin Turner was manipulating something, and the corridor was getting brighter.

No, the magic lamps in the instrument storage room where I was also shone brightly.

Suddenly, Saviolin Turner lit up the lights throughout the palace.

The possibility of escaping in the darkness disappeared.

If I wanted to leave, I had to do so while she was away from her post.

As expected, Saviolin Tana didn't move.

I couldn't move either.

The die had already been cast.

I held my breath, hoping that nothing would happen, but at the same time, I was convinced that something would inevitably happen.

I held my breath.



* * *



It was a dull affair.

But it was also horribly tense.

I was focused on suppressing any movements in my body to avoid alerting Saviolin Turner's senses.

Saviolin Turner didn't move from her spot.

My absence from Temple could become a problem.

If nothing happens, what excuse will I give for sneaking out of Temple?

Various minor problems started to surface, but all of that could wait until Charlotte and I made it through the day unharmed.

It was already late at night.

It was definitely past midnight.

For some reason, Saviolin Turner lit up the entire empty palace as if trying to drive away the darkness.

Even the instrument storage room where I was hiding was illuminated, but she was in my line of sight, and she didn't notice me.

I wonder how much time has passed in this boring state.

-Pop!

The light in the instrument storage room went out.

Not only that, but the light coming from the hallway also disappeared after a moment.

I don't know how the lighting in the palace is controlled.

Saviolin Turner didn't move. Did she turn off the lights?

Why would she turn off all the lights that she had just turned on?

No, she didn't turn off the lights.

As I cautiously extended my head towards the hallway, I saw a different sight.

All the magic lamps in the palace were flickering and blinking, going out one by one.

"No...How could this happen..."

Saviolin Turner's small murmurs were heard. It was a voice of astonishment and fear.

I can't think of any reason other than Charlotte turning off the lights.

How is this possible?

How would someone do such a thing?

I don't know.

Saviolin Turner stood up from her seat and began to move. Based on her direction, she was heading towards Charlotte's bedroom.

My breathing is ragged, and my whole body stiffened, trying to remain undetected.

She shouldn't be looking for me.

I used every possibility and chance given by the Revise function, so I would not be exposed. So I had to make sure to conceal my existence with all my might.

Although it is unlikely that I will be exposed in the future, if I suddenly make a sound, anything could happen.

I have no intention of testing whether I can change the predetermined future or not.

I cannot make the gamble to make my life any more dangerous than it already is.

"Your Majesty! If you're awake, please answer me!"

Saviolin Turner shouted as she walked down the corridor.

"Your Majesty!"

She called out to Charlotte as she headed towards her bedroom.

The Spring Palace in the darkness

-Flash!

-Krrrrrng

On a rainy night, it was even darker and it was impossible to distinguish anything without the occasional flashing lightning.

No, because of the lightning's brightness, my eyes couldn't adjust to the darkness. The light was actually disturbing my vision.

-Your Majesty!

I heard Saviolin Turner's urgent cry.

-Thunk

I heard the sound of Charlotte's bedroom door opening.

-....

There was no sound from Saviolin Turner; there was no sound of the door opening before she opened it.

So, is Charlotte sleeping?

-...disappeared again...

She disappeared.

I heard her spiritless, despairing murmur.

In that moment.

-Flash!

"!"

I almost screamed at the moment of the flash.

Something appeared before my eyes in the momentary flash of light.

Something was there.

-Krrrr...

After a brief silence following the flash, the sound of thunder shaking the window followed.

What is it?

Right now.

What is in front of my eyes?

I stared ahead with my eyes wide open, but I couldn't see the appearance of that thing watching me in the darkness. I didn't see it wrong.

Something was definitely watching me.

It wasn't there a moment ago, but it suddenly appeared.

-Flash!

Once again, the lightning bolt dispelled the darkness for a moment.

A shape appeared before my eyes, for an instant, and then it was gone.

I saw it clearly.

A figure.

It was smiling at me.

Something that looked like Charlotte.

Something that could never be Charlotte was watching me in the pitch blackness.

I couldn't see anything.

But the presence of the thing in front of me was palpable.

"Hehe."

"Hehehehe..."

"Hehehehehehe..."

I could hear the sound of its eerie laughter right by my neck.

Flash!

In the momentary illumination, I was able to see its appearance clearly.

Dark hair like the abyss, black eyes as deep as the darkness, and vertically slit crimson pupils.

It was more akin to the appearance of a demon.
