The expression on its face twisted at the sight of me. Displeasure spread through the smirk that had been there.

Did it recognize Tiamata?

Krrrrng!

From the dark wall that blocked the entrance, not a blade, but a wave.

We knew it wasn't going all out, it was just messing around.

With that, we were certain.

Today's victim would be Saviolin Turner.

"Hup!"

-Kwaaaang!

We couldn't block the waves with swords.

But she didn't need a sword.

Within a magical shield surrounding her, she neutralized the darkness billowing in, unleashing an incredible amount of power.

-Krrrrnk!

The impact was enough to crack the palace floor, and I was amazed, despite the situation.

Could it be that even monsters at the  Grandmaster level, who surpassed even heroes, could accomplish this with just a pure magical discharge?

It was hard to believe that this was her power in her worst condition.

Darkness rained down from all directions. Although Charlotte, who was blocking our path, was right in front of us, I turned my body towards the intense sense of hostility coming from behind.

The darkness is closing in on me.

As I maximize my physical enhancements.

I believe.

I may not be able to do it as well as Saviolin Turner, but I believe I can.

No, it's not just believing.

I've already succeeded.

The second one should be easy.

With extreme exhilaration coursing through my body, I receive the blades of darkness rushing at me with Tiamata.

-Clang!

"Ugh!"

I could barely contain my admiration for not spitting up blood.

The power behind it was so strong that I thought my hands would tear apart.

-Clang! Clang! Clang!

Saviolin Turner was slowly approaching Charlotte as she descended the stairs.

Is this fight meaningful?

Even if we approached her, Charlotte could dissolve and disappear into the darkness. Can we subdue Charlotte before that happens?

There's no guarantee that she can still do it just because she did before. Charlotte was also focused on attacking Saviolin Turner rather than me.

As long as I'm alive, that's all that matters.

I just need to stay out of Turner's way. The moment I get her to pay attention to me, it's all over.

-Shiiiik!

-Thud!

"Ugh!"

Fortunately, Tiamata was effective against this darkness. If it had been an ordinary sword, it would have been cut or simply missed the blade of this darkness.

This is not swordsmanship. I have never learned to fight against something like this.

But the nature of fighting is that you can't choose your opponent.

I don't know how, but I have to.

I can only keep my eyes on the attacks coming at me, and focus on countering them.

-Thud! Thud!

It was almost like watching a monster as Saviolin Turner rampaged and charged towards Charlotte.

Waves of darkness rush in, she pushes them back with a blast of magic, and blades scatter with a single sword pressure.

I have no idea what she’s capable of when she's at her best.

Saviolin Turner rushes at Charlotte in the nick of time and tries to grab her.

-Snarl

It just disappeared as if it melted into the darkness.

"Damn it...!"

It appeared twenty steps away from Turner on the right.

Around Charlotte, shadows in the shape of spears were shooting out.

-Clang! Clang! Clang!

Once again, she charges forward.

Despite piercing through the storm of blades and attempting to subdue Charlotte, she disappears into the darkness just before Turner reaches her.

She's a spear that pierces through anything, but the shield she's supposed to pierce won't let her.

Then she must be faster. She must catch her before she disappears.

However, Saviolin Turner, who is already using all her strength, cannot get any faster.

To be faster, she must extend her sword, not her hand.

Soon, inevitably, she must kill Charlotte.

Savioline Turner, who only had the option of subduing her, had a future of being killed by the being who controlled the darkness after exhausting herself.

I was already on the verge of my limits just by blocking the shadow blades that were charging towards me.

I couldn't help Saviolin Turner, and even if I tried to help, it would only put her in danger.

"Urgh!"

It wasn't just a problem of poor condition.

I could see her right shoulder soaked in blood.

Come to think of it, she had been wielding Tempesta with her left hand all this time.

Her right hand was completely useless, but as the situation became more urgent, she was now wielding the sword with both hands.

Could it be that she's right-handed?

If that's the case, then it means that this right-handed person has been using her sword only with the left hand until now.

Of course, there are many cases where one uses the sword with both hands, but losing the use of one arm means a decrease in combat power by half, or even more.

That's why it was clear that Savioline Turner, who was using even her injured right arm, had a wound that had not been properly treated burst open.

Gritting her teeth, Turner's eyes were bloodshot.

"Heheh...hehehe...hi. Hihihi...."

Charlotte was laughing.

She was enjoying watching Turner reaching her limits.

Three times since then.

Turner succeeded in getting close to Charlotte, using her injured right arm.

But right at the moment of her victory, she reached out her hand instead of her sword.

She could have killed her three times, but she tried to subdue her three times.

-Kwang!

"Ugh!"

That's why she was hit by the blade of darkness and hit the wall, her right arm completely destroyed.

-Kukong!

As she hit the wall, I could clearly see the cracks spreading like spider webs on the wall as if she had hit a rock.

"K...huh!"

-Thud!

She spat up blood, sprawled across the floor.

No way.

Is she dead?

I can't tell.

If she's not dead yet, she will be at this rate.

-Swish!

A darkness spear was thrown at Saviolin Turner for the final blow.

I have to block it.

No.

I will block it.

-Crunch!

My body, which responded to my desperate wish, surpassed its limits and swept away the darkness spear that was rushing towards Saviolin Turner.

I stood in front of her, who had collapsed.

Charlotte looked at me with a chilling smile, blocking my way.

I can't tell if she understands me or not.

Is it a creature created solely of malice?

It only has the intention to kill, and cannot communicate or converse.

Saviolin Turner lost consciousness.

Charlotte said that she loses her memories when her abilities go berserk.

If that's the case, there's no reason to hesitate now.

I had somewhat expected this moment to come.

There is only one being in the world who can push the strongest person in the world like this, even if they are in the worst condition.

The former Demon Lord, Valier.

I use Sarkergar's ring.

"As the ruler of the demonic realm and the rightful ruler of the Darklands, I ask."

I stare at it as I return to the appearance of Valier.

"Who the hell are you?"

Unfortunately, I didn't get the reaction I was hoping for.

"Hehehehehehehe..."

It was just a thick and low laugh like the first time.

It wasn't a demon.

Or is it just a kind of leftover that is something like fragments of the Demon Lord's madness? I fixed my grip on Tiamata while looking at it..

I didn't expect much from it, but my Demon Domination didn’t have any effect. I don't know if it's because my ability level is low or because it's a leftover of an Archdemon, but I couldn't tell.

There is only one result.

Whether I reveal myself as Valier or not, there is no choice but to fight.

I return to the appearance of Reinhardt.

I didn't want to fight as Valier.

I say as I look at it.

"If you're not the Demon King, then not recognizing your own king would be your sin..."

I grip Tiamata tightly.

"And if you are the Demon King, not recognizing your own son would be your sin as well."

"Keh, heh. Heh heh. Hih."

It becomes more and more engulfed in madness, preparing waves of darkness.

"But what makes me the most angry is that you're causing a fuss using Charlotte's body."

-Oooong

Tiamata cries.

A strange sensation as if the sword itself is screaming.

"So, no matter what you are, you deserve to be punished for making me angry."

A barrage of dark spears rush towards me.

Tiamata's condition is not good.

Now is the time, I think.

I reach out with Tiamata towards the dark spears coming at us.

-Flash!

The light that exploded around Tiamata filled the Spring Palace in an instant.

Sacred magic, Sanctuary.

"Kyaaaaak!"

I have successfully activated the magic planted by Olivia Lanze.



* * *



I've been working on this for a while now.

I share Tiamata with Olivia Lanze, so I had that conversation with Olivia.

About Tiamata.

-You know, this thing called Tiamata.

-Yeah. What is it

-Honestly, it's kind of pointless, isn't it?

-But it's a sacred relic, Isn't that a bit harsh?'

-Well, it's not like it's a god itself, it's just a creation of a god. And I didn't say that Sacred Relics are useless.

-Then what's useless about it?

-It's like the compatibility isn't good.

Olivia understood what I was saying.

-Well... Tiamata and Alixion are Holy Relics that have always been used by the sect. Reinhardt, aren't you the first person to become a champion of Towan without being a priest of Towan?

-That's what I'm saying. I don't know how to use divine power, but this is an amplifier for divine power. What am I supposed to do with it?

-But the sword itself feels good, right? Of course, there is talk that if innocent lives are harmed by Tiamata, the wielder will receive Towan's judgment.

-That's superstition.

In the first place, if judgment would be rendered when this sword spills innocent blood, it wouldn’t have turned corrupted at all. 

-Well, I know that, but… but what if I told you that the official doctrine of the Towan Order is superstition?

-If it's not true, it's superstition. You should know better by now, shouldn't you?

-I do, but Reinhardt, you're so....... you're so blunt.......

Anyway, here's the thing.

Tiamata is a very powerful Holy Relic, but it's basically for priests and paladins, and in my hands, it's no more than a particularly sharp knife.

Unlike with the other Holy Relics like Lament or Alsbringer, if the wielder didn’t have divine power, it couldn't live up to the hype of a Holy Relic.

Olivia looked at me as if to say, 'So what do you want me to do about it?'

-I mean, you and I own this thing together, right?

-Heh, I mean, it's like co-owned real estate, which is kind of nice.......

-No, why would you bring that up?

-What? We're not co-owning real estate, we're bound by our souls, Reinhardt. We're soulmates, we've already...we've gone as far as we can go.

-Ugh, stop it!

-You're always angry! I hate you! Even though you treat me poorly, I still follow you around when you call me. Isn't that cute?

-Shut up and listen to me.

-Ugh, what now?

For Olivia Lanze, who seems to have more and more characters, that's what I wanted.

-Tiamata is like an amplifier of divine power.

-The inherent divine power in it is immense. Whether in the form of Towan or Kier.

-Can't I use that divine power that's embedded in it?

-Hmm?

Olivia cocked her head.

-So, you're asking if you can use the divine power imbued in the sword itself?

-Yes.

-That's a creative idea. Maybe you should join the Towan sect first. People will love it. 'A champion came on his own!' they'll say.

-You know that's not what I mean.

I cannot use divine power. But the relic I possess is an item that can maximize the power of those who possess divine power. The Tiamata that I hold is a well-balanced sword that works well against undead.

However, if it is given to  the hands of a paladin, which is basically a human tank, they’d become weapons of abject slaughter.

I want to bring out the power of Tiamata even more.

So I asked Olivia Lanze for help.

-Can you imbue Tiamata with power, so that I can activate it when needed?

-Well...that concept does exist. There are items imbued with divine magic, like magic tools or artifacts, that non-believers can use.

-Is there something like that?"

-Yeah, but I don't know if it applies to relics. And it can’t do large-scale miracles or powerful divine magic, it's limited to a small level.

-But this situation is unique. There's only one object, but two owners. And two soul bounds.

Although I hate to admit it, even if Olivia Lanze and I weren't connected by the soul, we were connected with a Holy Relic as a medium.

I wanted to know if it was possible for me to exert the same influence on Tiamata that Olivia did.

-Hmm, I don't know. We'll have to try it out. But why?

-It wouldn't hurt to find a way to use the relic better. You never know when and where something might happen.

-Hmm... Are you planning on doing something bad again?

-No, who said that?

-You are. Even if you're not thinking about it now, you'll use it for something bad later.

Right.

I had intentions back then.

I wasn't trying to use it in this way now.

When trouble arose with the vampires in the Vampire Council, powerful divine magic would come in handy.

It was a plan to threaten the vampires, and I couldn't tell Olivia my true intentions.

With that intention in mind, I had been training Olivia Lanze to imprint divine magic on Tiamata and using it myself.

Of course, it didn't work well.

Without imprinting the talent for divine magic, it was impossible to do such a thing. And because divine magic was built on faith and prayer, it didn't suit me as a person even before I became a demon king. I only needed to believe in myself, but I didn’t need to believe in something else.

But now I had a conviction that somehow it would work out.

Tiamata was crying.

It gave me a feeling as if the sword had awakened, and that feeling gave me confidence.

I could do it now.

"Kiaaack! Kyaaack!"

-Kurrurung!

I was holding Tiamata tightly in my hand, putting all my strength into it, in the midst of a fierce collision between the light of the Sanctuary  and the darkness emanating from the remnants of the demon king.

The holy sword Tiamata.

It was emitting divine power in response to my will.

I was watching as the white runes on Tiamata's pure white sword shone.

‘I will purify the world with wrath.’

As I looked at those words, I suddenly realized.

Anger.

Tiamata responds to anger.

My anger at that scum who dared to swallow Charlotte's soul was drawing out Tiamata's power.

-Kurung! Kurung! Kurung!

It was pushing its hands towards me, in agony.

"Ugh...ugh!"

-Kuwoong!

It was just the collision of intangible forces, light and darkness.

But it felt like I was engaged in a power struggle, pushing and shoving against each other.

As it pushed me back with its force, I had to take a step back.

-Kururrring!

The clash of light and darkness created a thunderous roar. They collided and began pushing each other back.

It was the strongest undead slaying sword.

But the light emanating from Tiamata.

It provided a clear response to the existence that moved through darkness and attacked through darkness.

The beams of light that clashed and scattered were clearly blocking that being's movement.

I had to push it back and overpower it.

I had to block every direction with light and subdue it.

I hadn't planned to use the stored power here, but I had to use it now.

Leading with the light emitting from the sword, I tried to take a step forward towards the dark presence that was pushing me with all its might.

With all my strength, I took a step and it retreated a step.

Push it against the wall, bind it with light, and subdue it.

-Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

The fierce clash of light and darkness created a fiery and lightning-like sound.

The darkness slowly receded as I walked forward.

While the light of a magic lamp can be extinguished, is it true that the light rooted in holiness cannot be quenched?

"Kwarrang!"

I screamed in a sound that felt like the world was collapsing.

"Bring me back Charlotte!"

"Kyaaahhh!"

It screamed in agony every time I walked forward.

It was definitely having an impact.

I'm not sure if the answer lies in holiness or in light, but it is suffering.

"Kyaahhh! Kyaah!"

It was emitting a monstrous scream, and the darkness surrounding me was trying to swallow and devour the area of light that spread out around me.

"Kukung! Kukukukung!"

The power of Olivia Lanze.

It was amplified even more by the intermediary called Tiamata.

It was not only defending against the attacks of the unknown entity emitting darkness, but also diligently driving out the darkness from this area.

Light is sporadic.

The light that sprays beyond the holy area emitted from the sword intertwines with darkness like a snake, burning and incinerating it.

It had a bizarre shape with bright light and black flames were both burning.

It was a chaotic scene where the beast named light and the beast named darkness entangled with each other, even though it was hard to believe what was happening right in front of my eyes.

"Ugh!"

However, the darkness didn't retreat easily.

The materialized darkness seemed to push back the materialized light, ultimately pushing me back with it.

It was a strange sensation, as if Tiamata had collided with a powerful magnetic force.

"Kyaaaah!"

It screamed and reached out to me with its hand, as if trying to push me away with all its might, and I pushed back with my arm, trying to resist.

It was exhausting.

"Kurururururung!"

I was still far away.

"Kuwung!"

And my opponent's strength was greater than mine.

I was being pushed back.

At this point, instead of moving forward, I had to put all my effort into not retreating.

"Injury... Bed rest... Crutches… No more of that shit......!"

I tightened my grip on Tiamata.

I added more strength.

All the strength I had left, I added to it.

I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't cough up blood, but I had to do something.

Believing that I won't cough up blood,

Hoping that by reaching it, I can restore Charlotte.

I can do it.

I use the power of Magic Body Enhancement.

I try to move forward by borrowing the power of maximum physical and magical reinforcement.

I must move forward.

-Crack!

Along with the intense sensation that every cell in my body is waking up from the tips of my fingers and toes.

-Mmmm!

Not only divine magic but also the protection of Olivia Lanze embedded in Tiamata strengthens my body.

-Tap. Tap tap!

Along with the intense muscle strengthening that makes every muscle and fiber in my body scream beyond its limits.

I believe.

I will take a step forward.

-Thump!

Despite only taking one step, a loud noise shook the entire palace.

My body was strengthened by the divine power bestowed by Olivia Lanze to prevent it from collapsing, and my muscle fibers were simultaneously ripping apart and regenerating in real-time, and my magic circuit felt like it was burning and boiling.

The steps I must take are more than thirty.

It is not difficult.

Just walking, that's all it is.

Nothing could be easier.

It's just that the steps are a little heavy.

-Thump!

Only twenty-nine steps remain.

-Krrrrr!

In the fierce battle between the surging darkness and light, the power that truly originates from me is not much, except for strengthening my magical and physical abilities.

No, even that is not my own power. It is also borrowed power.

There is only one thing I can do.

Walking one step forward while grinding my teeth, resisting the pain of my body that feels like it's about to break apart.

Overcoming the pain.

Not losing my mind.

Walking one step forward.

Continuing to walk those steps.

That's all there is to it.

I borrowed everything.

I have nothing of my own.

All of it is borrowed property.

With borrowed power, I must at least be fierce enough to wield this power that wasn’t mine.

"Ugh... ughhh!"

"Hu, huhihik! Hihil! Hihihihil!"

The black creature screamed, whether in madness or fear, it was unclear.

I keep believing.

I won't fall.

I take one step.

If I make this step twenty-eight times, I can get through tonight.

And if tomorrow is dangerous too, I'll save the day again.

Beyond tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, four days, five days, and beyond.

I'll get through each and every day.

For Charlotte, the child whose life I saved, and for something more than just survival.

I'll live a life worth living.

I'll give her that gift.

Beyond the boundaries of implication and belief, I'll dispel the darkness that shouldn't be here and put things back where they belong.

You, who loves flowers.

I will bring you back.

Just as I saved you once.

This time too.

And the next time.

And the time after that. Continuously.

"Ah! Ah! Ah!"

-Thump!

One step.

-Thump!

Two steps.

-Boom!

Three steps, all at once.

-Whoosh!

-Clack, clack, clack, clack!

Ignoring the pain felt when bones break and reconnect.

If you believe you are feeling pain, then you’ll feel it..

But if you believe you aren't, then you won’t feel it.

Self-Suggestion.

Even surpassing that power.

Blood flowing from my eyes obscured my view.

But my eyes do not close.

-Boom!

Taking the next step, I continued onward to the figure whose features grew increasingly frightened, as I saw through my blood-stained vision.

Towards the fragment of the Demon King.

But also towards Charlotte.

I walked.

-Boom!

-Crackle!

Taking one more step that was already faltering, I walked again and again until I could reach that existence with my grasp.

"Kiiiiiaaaaaak!"

As its hair, black like the abyss, fluttered in the light, shock and fear overflew from those torn red pupils.

Right before me.

Unable to escape. It was having a hard time enduring, though I was no different.

With a burst of energy that made it seem like my body was blown by a gust of wind, I reached out my hand and gripped its neck.

The nails of the right hand that gripped Charlotte's neck broke and the bone twisted.

-Grrrrrr!

"K...uh...! Uhh...uhh...!"

Self-Suggestion is a power that only works on me.

If I believe it, that belief would affect only me.

I have to go beyond that stage.

It's not just me who should be affected.

Others should also be involved.

"Disappear...!"

"Hehehehehehehe! Huk! Hihuk! Hiiiiik!"

To apply this power to others, I must declare it out loud, not just believe it.

It's not the power that comes from believing, but the power that comes from saying it will happen.

I want it.

Because I want it, I will have it.

"Disappear from Charlotte's body!"

[Rank of Self-Suggestion increases.]

[Reached A-rank in Self-Suggestion.]

[Derived ability activated.]

[Awakening of Word Magic.]

-Flash!

My words.

Moved the world.

In the darkness.

On a rainy night.

-Rumble

Charlotte realized she was being held by someone in the darkness.

"Uhh... who, who is..."

"...Are you awake?"

Although she couldn't see clearly, Charlotte knew it was Reinhardt's voice.

"Rein...hardt? Reinhardt?"

"Yeah..."

From his hoarse voice, she could tell that the situation was not good. Why hasn’t he gone back? Why was she in the palace hall instead of her bedroom?

As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, Charlotte could see.

The fallen chandelier, the palace that had become a mess like a giant beast had run wild.

And.

Reinhardt's face, so badly injured that it was amazing that he was still alive.

He was taking care of Charlotte, using his knee as a pillow, despite his injuries.

She doesn't know what the situation is, but...

She doesn't know why he didn’t go back, but...

Charlotte vaguely realizes.

"Did I... hurt you...?"

![Image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/illustrations/Ch-271.jpg)

In the end, she lost her sanity again, and then she hurt Reinhardt with this omnious power.

It could only be me, there would be no one else who would do such a thing.

In despair and guilt, in a moment when Charlotte was about to burst into tears...

-Swoosh-

"No."

Reinhardt, trembling with his hand severely injured to the point where his bones were visible, brushed her hair carefully.

"It's not that you hurt me..."

Reinhardt looked down at her while stroking her hair.

"It’s that I saved you...."

Charlotte couldn't understand what he was talking about.

"Just remember that...."

Although it was true that he was hurt, Reinhardt only spoke as if to remind her of something more important.

"What happened? Reinhardt, what happened... What happened?"

Although she wanted to hear an explanation, Reinhardt was not in a condition to do so.

"I'm sorry I threw away the flower."

Reinhardt made a completely unrelated comment.

What a trivial matter.

He's injured, and then he's apologizing out of the blue, not even looking for gratitude for saving her life.

"When I received something like that... In that situation, when I got something that means something like... that. I thought it might be the last gift I’d get from you... and I hate that..."

Please think of me.

A flower with such a meaning.

Reinhardt knew that it was a gift that conveyed a farewell, given without much thought.

"So I threw it away...."

To refuse the parting words Charlotte subtly offered.

Reinhardt had thrown away that flower.

With that, Reinhardt lost consciousness.
